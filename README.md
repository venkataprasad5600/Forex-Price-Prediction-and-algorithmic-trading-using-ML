# 📌  Forex-Price-Prediction-and-algorithmic-trading-using-ML.

# 📝 Overview
This project aims to develop algorithmic trading strategies using machine learning to predict forex price movements. By leveraging historical forex data, statistical analysis, and machine learning models, the system attempts to make data-driven trading decisions to optimize profitability.

# 🏷️ Datasets
The dataset contains historical forex price data, including currency pairs like EUR/USD and USD/INR. Each record consists of:
Date & Time: Timestamp of recorded price
Ask Price: The price at which traders buy a currency
Bid Price: The price at which traders sell a currency

# ✨ Project Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing price data, and feature engineering
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends, patterns, and price movements
Machine Learning Models:
Regression models for price prediction
Classification models for trend direction
Reinforcement learning for trade execution
Backtesting Strategy: Evaluating trading performance on historical data
Visualization: Candlestick charts, trend indicators, and predictive insights
# 🛠️ Technologies and Tools Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
NumPy, pandas – Data handling
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization
scikit-learn – Machine learning algorithms
TensorFlow/PyTorch – Deep learning models (if applicable)
forex-python – Real-time forex data retrieval

# 🚀 Future Improvements
Implementing deep learning for more accurate predictions
Enhancing trading strategy with reinforcement learning
Deploying the model as a real-time forex prediction API
